This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and you try to render a large number of items.  The key is often missing or inconsistent, leading to React Native not being able to efficiently update the list.  This can manifest as slow rendering, incorrect item positioning, or even crashes.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

This example is missing a `keyExtractor` function, which is crucial for FlatList performance and proper rendering.

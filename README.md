# React Native FlatList Rendering Issues: Missing or Inconsistent Keys

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `FlatList` component in React Native: rendering problems due to missing or inconsistent keys.  The example shows how a missing `keyExtractor` leads to performance issues and incorrect rendering. The solution provides the correct implementation with `keyExtractor` function, improving the rendering efficiency and resolving related issues.

## Bug Description:
The `FlatList` component in React Native requires a `keyExtractor` prop to efficiently manage and update list items. Without a proper `keyExtractor`, React Native can struggle to keep track of changes and accurately re-render the list, causing slow rendering, incorrect item display, and even crashes, especially with a large dataset.

## Solution:
The solution involves adding or correcting the `keyExtractor` prop in your `FlatList` component. The `keyExtractor` should return a unique key for each item in the data array.  This ensures that React Native can properly identify and update individual items in the list efficiently.
